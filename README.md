# note on history-search-multi-word 

the most important zsh plugin is https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/history-search-multi-word

on a new machine whose dot files i'm not even gonna bother uploading since zplugin died, i've just sourced the cloned repo in this repo at the end of the new `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
source ~/totfiles/history-search-multi-word/history-search-multi-word.plugin.zsh
```
